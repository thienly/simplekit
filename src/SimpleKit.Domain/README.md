**The list need to be done for this project**
- [x] Entity  
- [x] Values Objects    
- [x] Define events
- [x] AggregateRoot with Events
- [x] Repository abstraction
- [x] UnitofWork abstraction  
**Why do we need Repository Pattern** 
- Two reason to use Repository pattern instead of ORM directly  
- Hide complexity: The user only focus on business logic, they shouldn't care how object is manipulating with data provider  
- Support multiple provider. From micro ORM to big ORM
**Unit of work pattern**
